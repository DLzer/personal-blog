	<h1>Hey, I'm Dillon ðŸ‘‹</h1>

	<p>This is a blog about my experiences as a software engineer and web application developer.</p>

	<p>
		I'm fascinated by learning the newest technologies, breaking and rebuilding existing projects,
		and sharing what I've learned with others. This blog serves as an outlet for my chaotic-neutral
		cycle of learn->break->teach and I hope you enjoy the ride.
	</p>

	<p>
		When I'm not writing blogs for this site you can catch me doing Lead Engineer stuff for <a
			href="https://volum8.co">Volum8</a
		>. Or possibly even working on some side projects with
		<a href="https://brokenreality.com">Broken Reality</a>. If you're feeling up to it check out my
		<a href="https://github.com/dlzer">GitHub</a> where there's always some trouble brewing.
